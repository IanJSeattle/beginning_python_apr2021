We now have a basic Blackjack game, which allows a single player to
receive cards, hit, stay, and see whether their cards busted, beat the
dealer's cards, or were beat by the dealer's hand.  The dealer is
clever enough to hit at 16 points or lower.

For this exercise, please add a second player.

This will involve keeping track of multiple player hands, as well as
allowing both players to understand when it's their turn to interact
with the program.

Follow the established patterns in the main() function to add the
second player.  For this exercise, call them "Player 1" and "Player
2," but you could ask for real names if you have time.  Remember that
when you find yourself writing (or copying) the same code over and
over, it's probably a good time to turn that code into a separate
function.

For bonus points, think about how you'd modify the program to take an
arbitrary number of players, using loops and lists.

Please limit yourself to 60-90 minutes on this exercise.  I don't know
if it's realistic to think it can be done in that amount of time, so
don't worry if you can't finish within that time.  Do note your
questions or frustrations for discussion in the next class!
