Welcome to the April 2021 Beginning Python class!

This Git repo is mostly for your reference.  All the HTML slide
decks used in class are stored here, for your review.  You can find
the exercise text here, as well

DIRECTORIES IN THIS REPO

html: This contains the slides we use in class.  Open any of the
.html files with your browser to see that deck's slides.  Navigate
using the arrow keys.  Most movements are to the right, but some decks
have a downward track as well (look for the arrows in the
lower-right corner as a hint).  Press the escape key to see a map of
slides.

exercises: Here we will put the instructions for class exercises, as
well as our demo code, once the exercise is complete.
